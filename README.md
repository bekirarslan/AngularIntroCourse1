# AngularIntroCourse1
This repository contains my notes and execution of the angular beginner course from @MarkTechson at Angular youtube channel.

To kickstart my journey to angular, I chose the following course from Mark Thomson that is located at the angular official youtube channel at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT0lHYhHMY&list=PL1w1q3fL4pmj9k1FrJ3Pe91EPub2_h4jF">Learning Angular </a>.
I will be doing commits at least at every video and will include my notes at the code.
